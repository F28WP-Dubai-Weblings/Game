The game is supposed to be 2D and multi-player,it is a racing video game that is in third-person perspective, in which the player partakes in a racing competition along with their teammates. The goal of the game is to finish the racecourse while avoiding obstacles. Whoever finishes the race first will be the winner.

Node.js, VS Code, MySQL are some software's that we are going to use.
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript are going to be the main programming languages we will implement in this project.

We will be making a scoreboard that will display the first three rankers and your rank during the live game.
We have progressed with the obstacles, the player will be able to shoot bullets at other cars each player has 3 lives. After three lives the player will not be able to continue with the game. As for extra bonuses we have added fuels by which the persons acceleration will be increased.
